Description: Provides tools to benchmark, compare, and visualize flow cytometry normalization and alignment methods across devices, locations, and time points. Implements a simplified optimal transport distance (OTD) to quantify device and sample variability, integrates FlowSOM clustering for population-level analysis, and supports Bland-Altman plots for device agreement. Designed for multi-center studies, with utilities for automated preprocessing and standardized output generation.
