\title{Check Marker-to-Gate Mapping Against GatingSets}
\usage{
marker_to_gate_check(marker_to_gate, gatingsets)
}
\arguments{
\item{marker_to_gate}{A named character vector mapping each marker to one or more population gate names.
These gates are assumed to represent positively stained reference populations.}

\item{gatingsets}{A named list of \code{GatingSet} objects, one per sample or FCS file.
Names must match those used elsewhere in the analysis.}
}
\value{
No return value. Warnings are issued if any expected gates are missing from the corresponding GatingSet.
}
\description{
Validates whether all gates specified in a \code{marker_to_gate} mapping are present in the provided \code{GatingSet} objects.
The \code{marker_to_gate} mapping is used to define positive populations for each marker, which are
expected to be pre-gated. These positive populations serve as reference points to assess whether the
median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of markers shifts (e.g. over time or between devices).
}
\details{
This function is a diagnostic tool that ensures the integrity of reference populations used for downstream
MFI-based comparisons. Missing gates will be reported with sample-specific warnings.
