\usage{
cycompare_outcomes_plot(
  df,
  dfcol_grouping_supersamples = c("Study"),
  dfcol_grouping_samples = "Device",
  dfcol_outcomes = c("outcome_1", "outcome_2"),
  dfcol_train_validation_other = "train_validation_test",
  dv_class_positive = c(outcome_1 = "A", outcome_2 = 5.1),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A \code{data.table} containing sample metadata. Must include columns specified by \verb{dfcol_*}
and a unique \code{File} column linking to \code{names(flowframes)}..}

\item{dfcol_grouping_supersamples}{Column(s) in \code{df} used to define supersample groupings (e.g., \code{"Study"}).
A supersample collects samples of same origin: A study collects samples from
multiple donors/patients, a patient might be in multiple times.}

\item{dfcol_grouping_samples}{Column in \code{df} that defines sample-level grouping (e.g., \code{"Device"}).
Each final biologically different sample could be measured with a different technology,
cytometer, or lab but SHOULD have the same values.}

\item{dfcol_outcomes}{Character vector of outcome column names to model (e.g., \code{c("outcome_1", "outcome_2")}).}

\item{dfcol_train_validation_other}{Column indicating sample usage role: \code{"train"}, \code{"test"}, etc.}

\item{dv_class_positive}{Named vector specifying the positive class for each outcome (e.g., \code{c("outcome_1" = "A", "outcome_2" = 5.1)}).}

\item{results_cycompare_analyse}{A named list returned by \code{cycompare_outcomes_analyse()},
containing components \code{prepared_data}, \code{clustering}, and \code{models}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list of generated plots. Side effects include:
\itemize{
\item Outcome visualizations grouped by metadata.
\item ICC plots comparing prediction consistency across devices.
}
}
\description{
Produces diagnostic plots from a full \code{cycompare_outcomes_analyse()} run.
This includes outcome distributions, ROC curves, and predicted probabilities grouped by supersample and device.
ICC (intra-class correlation) metrics are calculated for each outcome across devices.
