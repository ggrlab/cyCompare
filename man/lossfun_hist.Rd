\title{Compute Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) Between Matrices via Histograms}
\usage{
lossfun_hist(mat1, mat2, n_breaks = 100, lossfun = lossfun_hist_weighted, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat1}{A numeric matrix, where each column represents a variable or measurement.}

\item{mat2}{A second numeric matrix of the same dimensions as \code{mat1}.}

\item{n_breaks}{Integer. Number of histogram bins to use (default is 100).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{emd_fun}.}

\item{emd_fun}{A function to compute the Earth Mover's Distance between two binned distributions.
Must accept two matrices of equal shape and return a numeric scalar. Default is \code{emdist::emd2d}.}
}
\value{
A numeric value: the EMD between \code{mat1} and \code{mat2} over all columns.
Currently returns only the EMD between the two matrices as a scalar (element \link{2,1} of the matrix).
}
\description{
Computes the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between corresponding columns of two matrices
by binning values into histograms and comparing them using a specified EMD function.
}
\details{
Each matrix is converted into a set of histograms (one per column) using globally shared bin breaks.
EMD is then computed between the two matrices by applying \code{emd_fun()} to the binned data.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
mat1 <- matrix(rnorm(1000), ncol = 10)
mat2 <- matrix(rnorm(1000, mean = 1), ncol = 10)
lossfun_emd(mat1, mat2)
}
