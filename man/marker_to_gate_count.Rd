\title{Extract Positive Populations for Marker-Level MFI Comparisons}
\usage{
marker_to_gate_count(marker_to_gate, dt_count_mfi)
}
\arguments{
\item{marker_to_gate}{A named list or vector mapping marker names to gating population(s)
(e.g., \code{list("CD4" = "/Singlets/CD4+", "CD8" = "CD8+")}).}

\item{dt_count_mfi}{A \code{data.table} containing MFI and count statistics, including columns
\code{"pop"} and \code{"File"} (typically from gated populations).}
}
\value{
A named list with:
\describe{
\item{marker_to_gate_dt}{A \code{data.table} with two columns: \code{"marker"} and \code{"pop"} representing the mapping.}
\item{dt_count_mfi_relevant}{A filtered \code{data.table} with rows corresponding to relevant gated populations.}
}
}
\description{
This function prepares a mapping between markers and their corresponding pre-gated
positive populations (as defined by \code{marker_to_gate}). It filters the provided
\code{dt_count_mfi} data to only include these relevant populations.
}
\details{
The conceptual idea is to define, for each marker, one or more positive populations
that were gated prior to analysis. These are used to assess changes in marker signal intensity -
for example, to evaluate whether median fluorescence intensity (MFI) differs between devices
or over time. This helps monitor signal drift or systematic bias in the measurement process.
