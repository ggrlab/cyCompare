\title{Save FlowSOM Prediction Results to Disk}
\usage{
flowsom_wrapper_saving(
  fs_applied,
  dir_out,
  modelname = "cells_asinh.random10k.cd3"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fs_applied}{A list of FlowSOM prediction results, typically returned by \code{flowsom_repeatsubsampling_apply()}.
Expected to contain the elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{"cells_clusters_from_train"}: List of predicted clusters per cell.
\item \code{"ncells_per_x"}: Named list of data.tables with cluster cell counts per sample.
\item \code{"proportions_per_x"}: Named list of data.tables with normalized cluster proportions.
}}

\item{dir_out}{A character string specifying the directory to which files should be saved.
Will be created if it doesn't exist.}

\item{modelname}{A string used as the base name for the saved \code{.qs} file of cell-level cluster
assignments (default: \code{"cells_asinh.random10k.cd3"}).}
}
\value{
No return value. Side effect: writes files to disk in the specified output folder.
}
\description{
Saves the output of a FlowSOM prediction run, including cluster assignments,
cell counts, cluster proportions, and phenotype metadata to the specified output directory.
}
